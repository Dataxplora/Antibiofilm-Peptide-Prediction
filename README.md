# Antibiofilm-Peptide-predition
##Workflow
1. Download Antibiofilm and non-biofilm active peptides sequences at http://www.baamps.it/browse, http://ab-openlab.csir.res.in/abp/antibiofilm/down.php, and https://aps.unmc.edu/. You can also use the example data in the data folder.  
2. Extract peptide feature (AAC: Amino Acid Composition, CTD: composition Trnasition Disitribution, DPC: Dipeptide Composition, NMR:Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, physiochemical property. 
) at http://cbb1.ut.ac.ir/FeatureCalc/Index
3. Download the biofilm.ipynb and run locally
